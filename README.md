Srt Subtitle Encoding Fixer
===========================

A hassle-free encoding-fixer for .srt subtitle files

Most subtitles files are not saved with the right encoding, specially those are in Farsi. So, they won't work on most platforms and applications. At the time, I wrote a tiny and very easy application in Qt 4.X for an ex to be able to easily convert her subtitle files to the right format.
